(Image data for Kevin (the person with glasses by the water) would be placed here. Since I cannot directly represent image data, I will represent this with a placeholder.)

// Placeholder for image data of Kevin (the person with glasses by the water)
// This would be the actual binary data of the PNG image.
// Example:
// const imageData = [0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A, ...];

// To use this, you would typically load the image data from a file or URL
// and then use it to display the image in a web browser or other application.
